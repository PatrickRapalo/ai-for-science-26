## Agent based Modeling vs Agent Oriented Programming

Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)
ABM is a simulation and research methodology used primarily in social sciences, economics, biology, and complex systems research. You create many simple autonomous agents with defined behaviors and let them interact to see emergent patterns at the system level.

Agent-Oriented Programming (AOP)
AOP is a software engineering paradigm for building intelligent systems. It extends object-oriented programming by treating agents as first-class entities with beliefs, goals, plans, and communication abilities.

Main Differences
ABM asks "What happens when many simple things interact?" while AOP asks "How do we build intelligent software that acts autonomously?"
ABM agents are often deliberately simplified to study system-level effects, whereas AOP agents are sophisticated with cognitive architectures. ABM is analytical/exploratory, while AOP is engineering/implementation focused.
Given your ML and data science background, you might encounter ABM more in research contexts (simulating user behavior, market dynamics) and AOP if you work on autonomous systems or distributed AI applications.
